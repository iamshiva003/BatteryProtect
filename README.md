## Performance Optimizations

### 🚀 **Memory & CPU Efficiency**
- **Adaptive Polling**: Dynamic polling intervals based on battery state (1s for critical, 5s for stable, 15s for background)
- **Smart UI Updates**: Only updates UI when significant changes occur (>1% battery level change)
- **Memory Caching**: Intelligent caching of battery information to reduce system calls
- **Weak References**: Proper memory management with weak references to prevent retain cycles
- **Background Processing**: Notifications processed on utility queue to avoid blocking UI

### 🔋 **Battery Life Optimizations**
- **Reduced Timer Frequency**: Status bar updates reduced from 10s to 5s intervals
- **Conditional Updates**: Only updates status bar icon when significant changes occur
- **Lazy Loading**: Popover created only when needed
- **Efficient System Calls**: Minimized IOKit calls with intelligent caching
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in memory usage tracking and alerts

### ⚡ **Fast Charger Response**
- **Power Source Monitoring**: Dedicated 0.5s timer for power source changes
- **Immediate Detection**: Instant response to charger connection/disconnection
- **Temporary High-Frequency Polling**: 0.5s polling for 10 seconds after power changes
- **Reduced Cache Time**: 2-second cache instead of 5-second for faster updates
- **Always Update on Power Changes**: UI updates immediately when power source changes

### 🖱️ **User Experience**
- **Click Outside to Close**: Popover automatically closes when clicking outside
- **Global Event Monitoring**: Detects mouse clicks anywhere on screen
- **Smooth Interactions**: Intuitive behavior matching macOS conventions
- **Transient Behavior**: Popover behaves like native macOS popovers
- **Right-Click Context Menu**: Quick access to app actions and battery info

### 📊 **Performance Monitoring**
- **Real-time Memory Tracking**: Monitors app memory usage every 30 seconds
- **Peak Memory Detection**: Tracks peak memory usage and alerts on high usage
- **Performance Logging**: Console output for debugging and optimization
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup on app termination

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `BatteryProtect.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run the project
4. The app will appear in your status bar

## Usage

- **Left-click the status bar icon** to open the battery information popover
- **Right-click the status bar icon** to access context menu with quick actions
- **Click outside the popover** to close it (intuitive macOS behavior)
- **Settings icon** (top-right) opens system battery settings
- **Automatic alerts** when battery is low or high while charging
